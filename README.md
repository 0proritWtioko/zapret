If your computer does not support Dell SupportAssist OS Recovery, Dell provides operating system recovery images online. This is for the Windows, Ubuntu, or Linux image that was factory installed on your computer. The Dell OS Recovery Tool provides an interface to quickly download and create a bootable USB drive to reinstall the operating system.
 
The Dell OS Recovery Tool helps you download the operating system recovery image that is customized for your Dell computer and create a USB recovery media. The Dell OS Recovery Tool allows you to download either Microsoft Windows, Ubuntu, or Linux operating system recovery image that was preinstalled on your Dell computer.
 
Yes, the **Advanced Mode** in the Dell operating system Recovery Tool allows you to create a USB recovery media. It uses an operating system image file in ISO file format. This is useful if you downloaded the operating system recovery image using a Linux, Mac, or Android device.
 
Windows 10 or Windows 11 or Windows 11 recovery image enables you to format the hard drive and install a clean copy of Windows 10. The file size of this recovery image is considerably higher than the Windows 10 or Windows 11 Automated by SupportAssist.

Dell SupportAssist OS Recovery provides a recovery environment with tools to diagnose and troubleshoot issues that may occur before your computer boots to the operating system. When your computer is unable to boot to the operating system after repeated attempts, it automatically starts SupportAssist OS Recovery. This recovery environment enables you to diagnose hardware issues, repair your computer, back up your files, or restore your computer to its factory state.
 
SupportAssist OS Recovery is supported on select Dell computers that run a Dell factory-installed Microsoft Windows 10 operating system. For the list of computers where SupportAssist OS Recovery is available, see the Dell SupportAssist OS Recovery Support Matrix under Dell SupportAssist OS Recovery Support Documentation.
 
Typical recovery image files for the operating system in an ISO file format are between 5-16 GB in size. (The file size varies between different operating systems.) Once the file is downloaded, the Dell operating system Recovery Tool verifies the integrity of the file before creating the USB recovery media. The time to download and verify that the integrity of the file can vary depending on network speed and file size.
 
You may receive a "Not enough space on drive" error. Where you download a large file through a Dell online application such as Dell OS Recovery tool. This is due to a space limitation on the hard drive where the files are being saved to. Some operating system recovery images can be up to 16 GB in file size.
 
To correct this error, free up additional disk space on the hard drive. For information about freeing up disk space in Microsoft Windows, see the Dell knowledge base article: How to Free up Disk Space in Microsoft Windows.
 
The operating system recovery image may not contain the latest device drivers for your Dell computer. The latest device drivers are available at Dell.com/support/drivers. After the operating system is installed, Dell Technologies recommends that you download and install the latest device drivers.
 
The Dell operating system Recovery Tool fails to launch after installation, or running the installer does not start the installation process. You can temporarily disable the anti-virus or anti-malware software that may be installed on the computer and then run the application or the installer again.
 
When your computer is unable to boot to the operating system even after repeated attempts, SupportAssist OS Recovery automatically starts. This recovery environment enables you to diagnose hardware issues, repair your computer, back up your files, or restore your computer to factory defaults.

The trouble is when I enter my service tag it prompts me to comply with its license aggreement and then just gives me a small .exe file to run on the laptop I want to recover. But I have no OS on that laptop.. since I wiped all the partitions and can't install an OS on that laptop due to its incompatibility with Win 10, Arch, Ubuntu etc..
 
Nowadays you can always use dells recovery image download tool. Not sure if older computers are supported, but I'm just downloading Windows 10 for my dell and looks good so far. maybe give that a try if you, like me, came to this forum thread in 2018 ;)

Windows recovery drive helps reinstall Windows if your computer experiences a major issue such as a hardware failure. Windows updates to improve security and PC performance periodically, so we recommend you recreate the recovery drive annually. The recovery drive is not a system image and creating a recovery drive does not backup your personal files, settings, or applications.

I must have got lucky then, because the Dell told me the same thing but I used the above steps to access a factory image on an OP3010 that did not show Dell Backup installed. I do remember that it had a hidden partition that I could only see from disk management area
 
Yep I found out when I was at a client and they had hose up a 1 month old system and I went to system restore and it was disabled! So started looking at new deployments over the last year and found that all were disabled. I found this also on laptops
 
Interesting, I have been seeing this on all systems I have deployed in the last year. Now all the system I deploy are from the Dell Outlet Store so maybe this is a policy on the refurbish systems and not the new systems.
 
"Hi, I recently upgraded my Dell Inspiron 14 from Windows 8 to Windows 10, and I had performed a 'Reset This PC' without keeping any files once and it had worked fine. I was trying to do it again today, but now it say that it 'could not find the recovery environment, please insert your installation/recovery media.'  
I don't have the installation/recovery media, I had upgraded from Windows 8. I was thinking of using the Media Creation Tool, but would they require me to re-enter my Windows product key? I don't think I have it since I bought my laptop activated.  
If anyone could let me know how to proceed to wipe my computer, that would be great. Thank you!"
 
Usually, an installation disc comes with your Windows 10 computer when you get it for the first time, which allows you to access Windows 10 recovery environment and use recovery tools to install, upgrade, reinstall or repair your computer per your needs.
 
However, this kind of disc is no longer provided in the recent years, you can choose to create an installation media using CD/DVD or USB manually. Also, you can create a Dell recovery disk in Windows 10. The steps are in the following.
 
Step 5. Select **Restore this system backup** -> **Restore system to other location** and click Next. If you schedule full/incremental/differential backup, you can specify the backup image you want to restore.
 
Then, you can use recovery tools in the Windows RE to reset your computer. If you want to completely restore your computer, you can use Reset this PC or Factory Image Restore. If you want to keep all your files and programs, the best way is to restore system image with System Image Recovery feature or third-party tool. It can greatly reduce the data losses.
